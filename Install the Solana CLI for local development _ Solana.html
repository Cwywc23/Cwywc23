local development environment, getting you ready to start developing and
deploying Solana programs to the blockchain.</p>
<a id="what-you-will-learn"></a>
<h2>What you will learn <a target="" href="/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development#what-you-will-learn">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>how to install the Solana CLI locally</li>
<li>how to setup a localhost Solana cluster/validator</li>
<li>how to create a Solana wallet for developing</li>
<li>how to airdrop SOL tokens for your wallet</li>
</ul>
<a id="windows-users-only"></a>
<h2>Windows users only <a target="" href="/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development#windows-users-only">#</a></h2>
<p>Users on Windows 10 or 11 should install:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>,
which provides a Linux environment that runs inside your existing Windows
installation. You can then run regular Linux software, including the Linux
versions of Solana CLI.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701">Windows Terminal</a>, a
modern terminal for Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#x27;ve installed both Windows Subsystem for Linux and Windows Terminal,
open Windows Terminal and start a new tab for your Linux distribution (e.g.
&#x27;Ubuntu&#x27;) using the <code>wsl</code> command.</p>
<p>Then continue with this guide, running each of the terminal commands within this
Linux terminal.</p>
<a id="install-the-solana-cli"></a>
<h2>Install the Solana CLI <a target="" href="/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development#install-the-solana-cli">#</a></h2>
<p>To interact with the Solana clusters from your terminal, install the
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools">Solana CLI tool suite</a> on
your local system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sh -c &quot;$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)&quot;
</code></pre>
<a id="setup-a-localhost-blockchain-cluster"></a>
<h2>Setup a localhost blockchain cluster <a target="" href="/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development#setup-a-localhost-blockchain-cluster">#</a></h2>
<p>The Solana CLI comes with the
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator">test validator</a> built in.
This command line tool will allow you to run a full blockchain cluster on your
machine.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">solana-test-validator
</code></pre>
<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--slashes">
<p><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> Run the Solana test validator in a new/separate terminal window
that will remain open. The command line program must remain running for your
localhost cluster to remain online and ready for action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configure your Solana CLI to use your localhost validator for all your future
terminal commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">solana config set --url localhost
</code></pre>
<p>At any time, you can view your current Solana CLI configuration settings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">solana config get
</code></pre>
<a id="create-a-file-system-wallet"></a>
<h2>Create a file system wallet <a target="" href="/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development#create-a-file-system-wallet">#</a></h2>
<p>To deploy a program with Solana CLI, you will need a Solana wallet with SOL
tokens to pay for the cost of transactions.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s create a simple file system wallet for testing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">solana-keygen new
</code></pre>
<p>By default, the <code>solana-keygen</code> command will create a new file system wallet
located at <code>~/.config/solana/id.json</code>. You can manually specify the output file
location using the <code>--outfile /path</code> option.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--slashes">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you already have a file system wallet saved at the default
location, this command will <strong>NOT</strong> override it (unless you explicitly force
override using the <code>--force</code> flag).</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="set-your-new-wallet-as-default"></a>
<h3>Set your new wallet as default <a target="" href="/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development#set-your-new-wallet-as-default">#</a></h3>
<p>With your new file system wallet created, you must tell the Solana CLI to use
this wallet to deploy and take ownership of your on chain program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">solana config set -k ~/.config/solana/id.json
</code></pre>
<a id="airdrop-sol-tokens-to-your-wallet"></a>
<h2>Airdrop SOL tokens to your wallet <a target="" href="/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development#airdrop-sol-tokens-to-your-wallet">#</a></h2>
<p>Once your new wallet is set as the default, you can request a free airdrop of
SOL tokens to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">solana airdrop 2
</code></pre>
<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--slashes">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <code>solana airdrop</code> command has a limit of how many SOL tokens can
be requested <em>per airdrop</em> for each cluster (localhost, testnet, or devnet).
If your airdrop transaction fails, lower your airdrop request quantity and try
again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can check your current wallet&#x27;s SOL balance any time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">solana balance
</code></pre>
